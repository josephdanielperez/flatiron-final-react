# CollaboWrite

## A collaborative, social book writing platform.

A user can create a book with chapters and then other users can contribute snippets to write a chapter.

This project was created by this repository's collaborators: Logan Gants, Ali Mullin, and Francis Rocco.

This project showcases the collaborators knowledge of key concepts like:

* Rails API backend
* React/Redux frontend
* HTML/CSS in conjunction with Bootstrap
* RESTful conventions

The Rails backend repository can be found [here](https://github.com/ahmullin/flatiron-final-api).
